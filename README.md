# ChurnAnalysis
Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. 
Nowadays, telecom industry faces fierce competition in satisfying its customers. The role of churn prediction system is not only restricted to accurately predict churners but also to interpret customer churn behavior.
Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company’s customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it.

## Goal :
To predict whether customer will churn or not in telecom industries.

## Dataset:-

Churn Telecom(23 categorical variables). There are total 50k+ rows and 58 columns in this dataset.
This dataset is imbalanced dataset where we need to predict two classes "Yes" or "No". In the dataset, there are 71% majority class which is less than 80% so I decided to go with accuracy as evaluation metric.
